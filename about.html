      <h2>Understanding Medical Billing</h2>
      <p>
        Medical billing is a payment practice within the United States healthcare system. The process involves the
        systematic submission and processing of healthcare claims for reimbursement. Once the services are provided,
        the healthcare provider creates a detailed record of the patient’s visit, including the diagnoses, procedures
        performed, and any medications prescribed. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
      </p>
      <p>
        The medical billing process includes patient registration, insurance verification, service documentation,
        coding, claim submission, adjudication, payment processing, and follow-up on unpaid balances or claim denials.
        Our expert team ensures smooth handling of this complex process, maximizing efficiency and minimizing errors.

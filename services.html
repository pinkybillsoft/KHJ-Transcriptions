          <h3>Medical Coding</h3>
          <p>
            KHJ Transcriptions services provides medical coding for over 40,000,000 charts annually in various specialties. Our continuous efforts to improve our coding and compliance through education, audits, and industry updates separate us from the competition. With our dedicated team of experienced medical coders, we provide the highest quality professional and facility coding services. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

          <h3>Eligibility Verification</h3>
          <p>
            We have a highly trained staff that performs eligibility verification of benefits to avoid delays or errors in insurance coverage. The team verifies coverage for primary and secondary payers via payer websites, automated voice systems, or calls, and we offer real-time pre-authorization for walk-in patients. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

          <h3>Denial & Accounts Receivable Management</h3>
          <p>
            Most carriers must pay the claim or provide a written denial within 30 days of receipt. With our proactive approach to handling denials, we improve “days in AR” substantially. Denials are segregated and forwarded to our denial management team for prompt resolution—we measure, monitor, analyze, and resolve denials from each payer. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Payment Posting & Payment Reconciliation</h3>
          <p>
            Insurance payments are posted to patient accounts from EOBs into client systems within 24–48 hours. We generate secondary claims and mail them to the correct payers. Daily payments are posted and reconciled with the bank’s deposit sheet every day. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

          <h3>ICD-10 Readiness</h3>
          <p>
            The conversion from ICD-9 to ICD-10 (effective October 1, 2014) expands codes from ~17,000 to over 155,000 and impacts documentation, coding processes, and workflows. KHJ Transcriptions Services is fully prepared so our customers are protected from productivity loss, denials, and revenue impact during such transitions. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

          <h3>Claim Submission & Clearinghouse Denials</h3>
          <p>
            After charges are posted, we submit electronic claims to respective payers (including HCFA 1500). We work all clearinghouse denials and provide feedback with suggestions to reduce future edits. Detailed reports are sent daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
